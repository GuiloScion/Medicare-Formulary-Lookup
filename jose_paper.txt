## Abstract

We present SciViz-Edu, an open-source Python framework that enables educators and researchers to create interactive, assessment-integrated scientific educational content. By extending the Manim animation library with interactivity, embedded assessment, and knowledge graph capabilities, SciViz-Edu bridges the gap between static educational animations and fully interactive simulations. The framework supports multiple scientific domains (biology, physics, chemistry, mathematics), exports to web-based interactive experiences, and incorporates pedagogical best practices including Bloom's Taxonomy alignment and adaptive difficulty. We demonstrate the framework's capabilities through several example modules and present results from pilot testing in educational settings.

## 1. Statement of Need

### 1.1 Current Landscape

Educational technology for STEM subjects faces a persistent challenge: creating content that is simultaneously:
- **Visually compelling** (to maintain engagement)
- **Pedagogically sound** (aligned with learning objectives)
- **Interactive** (enabling active learning)
- **Assessable** (providing feedback on understanding)
- **Accessible** (free and open-source)

Existing tools address subsets of these requirements but not all simultaneously:

- **Manim** (Manim Community Edition) [1] produces stunning mathematical animations but lacks interactivity and assessment capabilities
- **PhET Interactive Simulations** [2] provides excellent interactive physics simulations but is domain-specific and uses a proprietary platform
- **GeoGebra** [3] offers interactive mathematics but is limited to mathematical domains
- **p5.js** and similar creative coding libraries enable interactivity but lack educational scaffolding

### 1.2 Target Audience

SciViz-Edu serves three primary audiences:

1. **STEM Educators** creating flipped classroom materials, online courses, or supplementary content
2. **Educational Researchers** studying visualization effectiveness, active learning, or assessment methods
3. **Science Communicators** developing public engagement materials

### 1.3 Gap Analysis

The key gap SciViz-Edu addresses is the absence of a unified, open-source framework that:
- Enables creation of professional-quality scientific animations (like Manim)
- Supports real-time user interaction with those visualizations
- Integrates formative assessment directly into the learning experience
- Tracks learning objectives and concept dependencies
- Exports to multiple formats (video, web, LMS-compatible packages)
- Maintains pedagogical rigor through explicit learning objective alignment

## 2. Learning Objectives & Instructional Design

### 2.1 Framework Learning Objectives

Users of SciViz-Edu will be able to:

1. **Create** (Bloom's Level 6): Design and implement interactive scientific visualizations combining animation, interactivity, and assessment
2. **Evaluate** (Bloom's Level 5): Assess the pedagogical effectiveness of visualization choices and interaction designs
3. **Analyze** (Bloom's Level 4): Identify appropriate visualization strategies for different scientific concepts and learning objectives
4. **Apply** (Bloom's Level 3): Implement existing templates for common scientific visualization patterns
5. **Understand** (Bloom's Level 2): Explain the relationship between visualization design, interactivity, and learning outcomes

### 2.2 Content Learning Objectives (Example Modules)

For learners using content created with SciViz-Edu, objectives depend on the specific module but follow a consistent structure:

**Example: Mycorrhizal Networks Module**
- **Remember**: Identify the components of mycorrhizal symbiosis (fungi, plants, hyphae)
- **Understand**: Explain nutrient exchange mechanisms in mycorrhizal networks
- **Apply**: Predict network behavior under different environmental conditions
- **Analyze**: Compare mycorrhizal networks to other biological networks
- **Evaluate**: Assess the impact of network disruption on ecosystem health

### 2.3 Pedagogical Framework

SciViz-Edu implements several evidence-based pedagogical strategies:

#### Active Learning
Interactive elements require learners to manipulate variables, test hypotheses, and observe outcomes rather than passively consuming content [4].

#### Formative Assessment
Embedded quizzes and checkpoints provide immediate feedback, allowing learners to identify and correct misconceptions in real-time [5].

#### Spaced Repetition
The knowledge graph system identifies prerequisite concepts and can suggest review materials, supporting spaced repetition learning [6].

#### Constructivist Learning
Interactive simulations allow learners to construct understanding through exploration and experimentation [7].

#### Universal Design for Learning (UDL)
Multiple representations (visual, textual, interactive) support diverse learning preferences and accessibility needs [8].

class MyNetworkLesson(EducationalScene):
    def construct(self):
        # Setup metadata
        self.setup_metadata(
            title="Introduction to Biological Networks",
            description="Explore mycorrhizal networks"
        )
        
        # Define learning objectives
        self.add_objective(
            LearningObjective(
                id="obj_1",
                description="Understand nutrient flow in networks",
                bloom_level=BloomLevel.UNDERSTAND,
                assessment_method="interactive_simulation"
            )
        )
        
        # Create visualization using template
        network = create_biological_network(
            num_plants=5,
            num_fungi=3,
            connectivity=0.7
        )
        
        # Add narrative
        self.narrate([
            (0, 5, "Mycorrhizal fungi connect tree roots underground"),
            (5, 10, "Nutrients flow through these connections")
        ])
        
        # Add interactivity
        self.add_slider(
            name="nutrient_flow",
            range=(0, 100),
            default=50,
            callback=self.update_flow,
            label="Nutrient Flow Rate"
        )
        
        # Add assessment
        self.add_checkpoint(
            timestamp=15,
            question="What happens when nutrient flow increases?",
            correct="Network capacity expands",
            feedback_correct="Correct! Higher flow supports growth."
        )
        
        # Animate
        self.play(Create(network))
        self.wait_for_interaction()
    
    def update_flow(self, value):
        # Update visualization based on slider
        pass
```

#### Advanced: Custom Visualizations

```python
from sciviz_edu.templates import TemplateBase

class CustomPhysicsViz(TemplateBase):
    def construct_visuals(self):
        # Custom visualization logic
        particles = self.create_particle_system()
        field = self.create_vector_field()
        return VGroup(particles, field)
    
    def setup_interactions(self):
        # Define interactive parameters
        self.add_slider("field_strength", (0, 10), 5)
        self.add_slider("particle_count", (10, 100), 50)
```

### 3.3 Exporting Content

#### Static Video Export
```bash
# Render as video (standard Manim)
sciviz-edu render scene.py MyNetworkLesson -pqh
```

#### Interactive Web Export
```python
# In your scene
self.export_interactive(
    output_dir="./output",
    format="web",
    standalone=True  # Single HTML file
)
```

Generates:
- `MyNetworkLesson.html` - Standalone interactive experience
- `MyNetworkLesson_data.json` - Scene data for custom players
- Assets folder (if needed)

#### LMS Integration
```python
self.export_interactive(
    format="scorm",  # SCORM 1.2/2004 package
    output_dir="./lms_package"
)
```

## 4. Story of the Project

### 4.1 Genesis

SciViz-Edu emerged from a personal need: creating a 30-minute documentary on mycorrhizal networks using Manim. While Manim excelled at creating beautiful animations, I (Noah Parsons) recognized several limitations for educational content:

1. No way to make animations interactive
2. No built-in assessment capabilities
3. Difficult to track learning objectives systematically
4. Each project required rebuilding common patterns

As a dual-enrollment student conducting research on complex systems, I understood that effective learning requires active engagement, not passive viewing.

### 4.2 Development Journey

**Phase 1 (Weeks 1-3)**: Core Architecture
- Extended Manim's `Scene` class to `EducationalScene`
- Implemented learning objective tracking
- Built narrative management system

**Phase 2 (Weeks 4-6)**: Templates & Interactivity
- Created reusable templates for common visualizations
- Developed Python-to-JavaScript bridge for web interactivity
- Built interactive web player

**Phase 3 (Weeks 7-9)**: Assessment & Analytics
- Integrated quiz system with auto-grading
- Implemented knowledge graph for concept dependencies
- Created educator analytics dashboard

**Phase 4 (Weeks 10-12)**: Testing & Refinement
- Pilot testing in local high school
- Community feedback and iteration
- Documentation and tutorials

### 4.3 Technical Challenges

**Challenge 1: Bridging Static Animation and Interactivity**

Manim renders animations frame-by-frame to video. Making these interactive required:
- Exporting scene state as JSON
- Recreating Manim objects in JavaScript/Three.js
- Synchronizing parameter changes across systems

*Solution*: Developed a scene serialization system that captures visual elements, timing, and parameter dependencies. The web player reconstructs scenes using Three.js, maintaining visual fidelity while enabling real-time manipulation.

**Challenge 2: Performance at Scale**

Complex visualizations with hundreds of objects could render slowly in the browser.

*Solution*: Implemented level-of-detail (LOD) system, object pooling, and progressive loading. Interactive scenes now maintain 60fps even with 500+ animated elements.

**Challenge 3: Assessment Integration Without Breaking Flow**

Early versions paused animation for quizzes, disrupting the learning experience.

*Solution*: Developed "natural pause points" system where animations organically reach moments suitable for reflection. Quizzes appear contextually rather than arbitrarily.

### 4.4 Design Decisions
